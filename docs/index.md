# U.S. Marine Energy Resource Characterization

Reconnaissance-level, wave and tidal energy hindcast datasets for marine energy technology advancement in the United States developed to [IEC 62600-101](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/66062) [@iec_62600_101] and [IEC 62600-201](https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/22099) [@iec_62600_201] standards and publicly available through the [Marine and Hydrokinetic Data Repository (MHKDR)](https://mhkdr.openei.org) and the [Marine Energy Atlas](https://maps.nlr.gov/marine-energy-atlas).

!!! info "What is a hindcast?"
A **hindcast** is a physics-based ocean simulation run over a historical time period using recorded atmospheric and oceanographic conditions as inputs. Rather than measuring the ocean directly, hindcasts use validated numerical models to reconstruct what conditions _would have been_ at every location across a region, providing spatiotemporal coverage (data across both space and time simultaneously) that no observational network could practically achieve. The result is a consistent, gap-free record of wave heights, tidal currents, power density, and other variables across the U.S. coastline.

## About U.S Marine Energy Resource Datasets

Developing marine energy requires detailed, reliable data: where is the resource, how strong is it, how does it vary across seasons and depth, and what are the conditions a device would actually experience? Generating that data requires large-scale physics-based ocean simulation, numerical models of tidal currents and ocean surface waves, validated against observations, and processed into standardized formats that engineers and policymakers can use with confidence.

These datasets are the result of that effort. Developed collaboratively by [National Laboratory of the Rockies](https://www.nlr.gov), [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov), and [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov) with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's [Hydropower and Hydrokinetic Office (H2O)](https://www.energy.gov/cmei/water/hydropower-and-hydrokinetic-office), they represent a standardized, publicly accessible foundation for U.S. marine energy resource characterization.

## The Marine Energy Atlas vs. Publicly Available MHKDR Datasets

The [Marine Energy Atlas](https://maps.nlr.gov/marine-energy-atlas) is a visual exploration tool. It presents pre-computed summary layers, annual average wave energy flux, annual mean current speed, and more derived from these full hindcast datasets. The Atlas is the right starting point for identifying areas of interest and comparing resource potential across regions.

This documentation, and the underlying datasets, document and provide links to the data behind the Atlas layers:

- **Complete time series** at every model grid point, not just annual summaries
- **3D vertical structure (Tidal)** across depth layers (tidal) and spectral parameters (wave, virtual buoy)
- **IEC-compliant methodology** documentation for use in formal resource assessments
- **Direct data access** via [MHKDR](http://mhkdr.openei.org/632), HSDS, and AWS S3

  ***

  If you are exploring where marine energy resources exist in the United States, asking questions like _"where are tidal currents strongest?"_ or _"what does the wave energy resource look like off the Atlantic coast?"_, start with the [Marine Energy Atlas](https://maps.nlr.gov/marine-energy-atlas). The Atlas presents the summary data from these datasets in an interactive map you can explore without any technical background.

  <!-- This documentation provides details those Atlas layers mean and how the underlying data was produced. -->

  If you need to compare resource potential across sites, understand summary statistics, or work with aggregated data for feasibility studies, the variable documentation is the right place to start. Each layer shown on the Atlas is documented here with definitions, equations, units, and known limitations.
